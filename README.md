## Rain Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict rainfall based on various meteorological parameters. The model utilizes historical weather data to forecast the likelihood and intensity of rain.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
  ```

### Dataset
The model is trained on a weather dataset that includes features such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Atmospheric pressure
- Cloud cover

### Model Selection
The following models were considered:
- **XGBoost** (Preferred for its accuracy and efficiency)
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks

### Data Preprocessing
1. Handle missing values
2. Normalize numerical features
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Feature selection based on correlation analysis

### Training the Model
- Import datasets
- load dataset
- split the data
- Train the data
- evaluate the model

### Results and Evaluation
- Model accuracy: **~85%** (depending on dataset and tuning)
- Performance metrics:
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix

### Deployment
- Can be integrated into a web app using Flask or FastAPI.
- Deployed using AWS, GCP, or a local server.

### Future Improvements
- Enhance feature engineering
- Incorporate real-time weather API data
- Use deep learning models for better accuracy
